Ward 2021-02-23 Preface The MARSS R package allows you to fit constrained multivariate autoregressive state-space models. This manual covers the MARSS package: what it does, how to set up your models, how to structure your input, and how to get different types of output. For vignettes showing how to use MARSS models to analyze data, see the companion book MARSS Modeling for Environmental Data by Holmes, Scheuerell, and Ward. Installation To install and load the MARSS package from CRAN: install.packages(&quot;MARSS&quot;) library(MARSS) The latest release on GitHub may be ahead of the CRAN release. To install the latest release on GitHub: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(&quot;nwfsc-timeseries/MARSS@*release&quot;) library(MARSS) The master branch on GitHub is not a ‘release.’ It has work leading up to a GitHub release. The code here may be broken though usually preliminary work is done on a development branch. To install the master branch: install_github(&quot;nwfsc-timeseries/MARSS&quot;) If you are on a Windows machine and get an error saying ‘loading failed for i386’ or similar, then try options(devtools.install.args = &quot;--no-multiarch&quot;) To install an package from Github, you need to be able to build an package on your machine. If you are on Windows, that means you will need to install Rtools. On a Mac, installation should work fine; you don’t need to install anything.

Students in the workshops on MAR and MARSS modeling and the course at University of Washington have helped us refine the package. The Kalman filter and smoother functions used by the MARSS package are now those written by Jouni Helske for the KFAS package. Use of the KFAS Kalman functions has made the MARSS package faster and more stable. "],["part1.html", "Part 1. Overview", " Part 1.

"],["chap-overview.html", "Chapter 1 Overview", " Chapter 1 Overview MARSS stands for Multivariate Auto-Regressive(1) State-Space. The MARSS package is an R package for estimating the parameters of linear MARSS models with Gaussian errors. This class of model is extremely important in the study of linear stochastic dynamical systems, and these models are important in many different fields, including economics, engineering, genetics, physics and ecology. The model class has different names in different fields, for example in some fields they are termed dynamic linear models (DLMs) or vector autoregressive (VAR) state-space models. The MARSS package allows you to easily fit time-varying constrained and unconstrained MARSS models with or without covariates to multivariate time-series data via maximum-likelihood using primarily an EM algorithm. The EM algorithm in the MARSS package allows you to apply linear constraints on all the parameters within the model matrices. Fitting via the BFGS algorithm is also provided in the package using R’s optim function, but this is not the focus of the MARSS package. MARSS, MARSS() and MARSS. MARSS model refers to the class of models which the MARSS package fits using, primarily, an EM algorithm. In the text, MARSS refers to the R package. Within the package, the main fitting function is MARSS(). When the class of model is being discussed, rather than the package or the function, “MARSS” is used. "],["marss-model-form.html", "1.1 MARSS model form", " 1.1 MARSS model form A full MARSS model, with Gaussian errors, takes the form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} \\mathbf{x}_t = \\mathbf{B}_t\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{u}_t + \\mathbf{C}_t\\mathbf{c}_t + \\mathbf{G}_t\\mathbf{w}_t, \\text{ } \\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{Q}_t) \\\\ \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{Z}_t\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{a}_t + \\mathbf{D}_t\\mathbf{d}_t + \\mathbf{H}_t\\mathbf{v}_t, \\text{ } \\mathbf{v}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{R}_t) \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_1 \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}) \\text{ or } \\mathbf{x}_0 \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}) \\end{gathered} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] The \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) equation is termed the state process and the \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) equation is termed the observation process. Data enter the model as the \\(\\mathbf{y}\\); that is the \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is treated as the data although there may be missing data. The \\(\\mathbf{c}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d}_t\\) are inputs (aka, exogenous variables, covariates or indicator variables). The \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}_t\\) are also typically inputs (fixed values with no missing values). The bolded terms are matrices with the following definitions: \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a \\(m \\times T\\) matrix of states. Each \\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\) is a realization of the random variable \\(\\mathbf{X}_t\\) at time \\(t\\). \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is a \\(m \\times T\\) matrix of the process errors. The process errors at time \\(t\\) are multivariate normal with mean 0 and covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{Q}_t\\). \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is a \\(n \\times T\\) matrix of the observations. Some observations may be missing. \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a \\(n \\times T\\) column vector of the non-process errors. The observation erros at time \\(t\\) are multivariate normal with mean 0 and covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}_t\\). \\(\\mathbf{B}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Z}_t\\) are parameters and are \\(m \\times m\\) and \\(n \\times m\\) matrices. \\(\\mathbf{u}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}_t\\) are parameters and are \\(m \\times 1\\) and \\(n \\times 1\\) column vectors. \\(\\mathbf{Q}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R}_t\\) are parameters and are \\(g \\times g\\) (typically \\(m \\times m\\)) and \\(h \\times h\\) (typically \\(n \\times n\\)) variance-covariance matrices. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) is either a parameter or a fixed prior. It is a \\(m \\times 1\\) matrix. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) is either a parameter or a fixed prior. It is a \\(m \\times m\\) variance-covariance matrix. \\(\\mathbf{C}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D}_t\\) are parameters and are \\(m \\times p\\) and \\(n \\times q\\) matrices. \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) are inputs (no missing values) and are \\(p \\times T\\) and \\(q \\times T\\) matrices. \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}_t\\) are inputs (no missing values) and are \\(m \\times g\\) and \\(n \\times h\\) matrices. AR(p) models can be written in the above form by properly defining the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) vector and setting some of the \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) variances to zero; see Chapter . Although the model appears to only include i.i.d. errors (\\(\\mathbf{v}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_t\\)), in practice, AR(p) errors can be included by moving the error terms into the state model. Similarly, the model appears to have independent process (\\(\\mathbf{v}_t\\)) and observation (\\(\\mathbf{w}_t\\)) errors, however, in practice, these can be modeled as identical or correlated by using one of the state processes to model the errors with the \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) matrix set appropriately for AR or white noise—although one may have to fix many of the parameters associated with the errors to have an identifiable model.

"],["chap-quick-start.html", "Chapter 2 Quick Start", " Chapter 2 Quick Start If you already work with models in the form of Equation (1.1), you can immediately fit your model with the MARSS package. Install the MARSS package and then type library(MARSS) at the command line to load the package. The default MARSS model is: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:marss} \\begin{gathered} \\mathbf{x}_t = \\mathbf{B}_t\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{u}_t + \\mathbf{C}_t\\mathbf{c}_t + \\mathbf{G}_t\\mathbf{w}_t, \\text{ } \\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{Q}_t) \\\\ \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{Z}_t\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{a}_t + \\mathbf{D}_t\\mathbf{d}_t + \\mathbf{H}_t\\mathbf{v}_t, \\text{ } \\mathbf{v}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{R}_t) \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_1 \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}) \\text{ or } \\mathbf{x}_0 \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}) \\end{gathered} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) are inputs (aka, exogenous variables or covariates or indicator variables) and must have no missing values. They are not treated as `data’ in the likelihood but as inputs. In most cases, \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) are fixed (not estimated) and must have no missing values. \\(\\mathbf{w}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_t\\) are uncorrelated. The MARSS package is designed to handle linear constraints within the parameter matrices: \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\), \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) (and in limited situations \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\)). Linear constraint means you can write the elements of the matrix as a linear equation of all the other elements. Example: a mean-reverting random walk model with three observation time series: \\[\\begin{gather*} \\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\\\ x_2\\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix}b&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;b\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\\\ x_2\\end{bmatrix}_{t-1} + \\begin{bmatrix}w_1\\\\ w_2\\end{bmatrix}_t, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix}w_1\\\\ w_2\\end{bmatrix}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}\\begin{pmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix},\\begin{bmatrix}q_{11}&amp;q_{12}\\\\ q_{12}&amp;q_{22}\\end{bmatrix} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\\\ x_2\\end{bmatrix}_0 \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}\\begin{pmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix},\\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;1\\end{bmatrix} \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ \\\\ \\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\\\y_2\\\\y_3\\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;1\\\\ 0&amp;1\\\\ 1&amp;0\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\end{bmatrix}_t + \\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\\\ v_2\\\\ v_3\\end{bmatrix}_t,\\quad \\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\\\ v_2\\\\ v_3\\end{bmatrix}_t \\sim MVN\\begin{pmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix}r_{11}&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;r&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;0&amp;r\\end{bmatrix} \\end{pmatrix} \\end{gather*}\\] To fit with MARSS(), we translate this model into equivalent matrices (or arrays if time-varying) in R. Matrices that combine fixed and estimated values are specified using a list matrix with numerical values for fixed values and character names for the estimated values. B1 &lt;- matrix(list(&quot;b&quot;,0,0,&quot;b&quot;),2,2) U1 &lt;- matrix(0,2,1) Q1 &lt;- matrix(c(&quot;q11&quot;,&quot;q12&quot;,&quot;q12&quot;,&quot;q22&quot;),2,2) Z1 &lt;- matrix(c(1,0,1,1,1,0),3,2) A1 &lt;- matrix(list(&quot;a1&quot;,0,0),3,1) R1 &lt;- matrix(list(&quot;r11&quot;,0,0,0,&quot;r&quot;,0,0,0,&quot;r&quot;),3,3) pi1 &lt;- matrix(0,2,1); V1=diag(1,2) model.list &lt;- list(B=B1,U=U1,Q=Q1,Z=Z1,A=A1,R=R1,x0=pi1,V0=V1,tinitx=0) Try printing these out and you will see the one-to-one correspondence between the model in R and the math version of the model. Matrix names in the model list must be B, U, C, c, Q, Z, A, D, d, R, x0, and V0, although in many cases you will use the default values and do not need to specify for the model list. The tinitx element tells MARSS() whether the initial state for \\(x\\) is at \\(t=1\\) (tinitx=1) or \\(t=0\\) (tinitx=0). The data must be entered as a \\(n \\times T\\) matrix, a ts object (which will be converted to a \\(n \\times T\\) matrix) or a vector (which will be converted to a \\(1 \\times T\\) matrxi). MARSS() has a number of text shortcuts for common parameter forms, such as ``diagonal and unequal’’. The call to MARSS is fit &lt;- MARSS(data, model=model.list) The R, Q and V0 variances can be set to zero to specify partially deterministic systems. This allows you to write MAR(p) models in MARSS form for example. "],["linear-constraints.html", "2.1 Linear constraints", " 2.1 Linear constraints Your model can have simple linear constraints within all the parameters except \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\).

The code in the MARSS package is not particularly fast and EM algorithms are famously slow. You can try method=\"BFGS\" and see if that is faster. For some models, it will be much faster and for others, much slower. “BFGS” can be quite sensitive to initial conditions.

This puts it in verbose mode. Use fit=FALSE to set up a model without fitting. Let’s say you do fit &lt;- MARSS(..., fit=FALSE). Now you can do summary(fit$model) to see what MARSS() thinks you are trying to fit. You can also try toLatex(fit$model) to make a LaTeX file and pdf version of your model (saved in the working directory). This loads the Hmisc package (and all its dependencies) and requires that you are able to process LaTeX files (e.g. you have the tinytex package). Let’s say you specified your model with some text shortcuts, like Q=\"unconstrained\", but you want the list matrix form for a next step. a &lt;- summary(fit$model) returns that list (invisibly). Because the model argument of MARSS() will understand a list of list matrices, you can pass in model=a to specify the model.

However, the MARSS functions assume discrete time steps and you will need a value for each time step. Replace any missing time steps with NA. Why does MARSS require your data in matrix form? Because MARSS will not make any guesses about your intentions. You must be 100% explicit in terms of what model you trying to fit and what you consider to be data. MARSS models are used in many different fields in different ways. There is no guess that would work for all models. Instead MARSS requires that you write your model in matrix form, and then pass everything in in a format that is one-to-one with that mathematical model. That way MARSS knows exactly what you are trying to do. "],["ts-objects.html", "3.1 ts objects", " 3.1 ts objects A ts object (time series object) stores information about the time steps of the data and often seasonal information (the quarter or month). If you pass in a ts object as data into MARSS(), it will convert this to a matrix but it will ignore any information about the seasonality. It will store this information, but it doesn’t use it. If you have your data in ts form, then you may be using year and season (quarter, month) as covariates to estimate trend and seasonality. The next sections give examples of converting your data from ts form to matrix form with the season information. 3.1.1 Univariate ts object This converts a univariate ts object with year and quarter into a matrix with a row for the response (here called Temp), year, and quarter. z &lt;- ts(rnorm(10), frequency = 4, start = c(1959, 2)) dat &lt;- data.frame(Yr = floor(time(z) + .Machine$double.eps), Qtr = cycle(z), Temp=z) dat &lt;- t(dat) class(dat) Notice that the class of dat is matrix, which is what we want. There are three rows, first is the reponse and the second and third are the covariates, Year and Quarter. When you call MARSS, dat[\"Temp\",] is the data. dat[c(\"Yr\",\"Qtr\"),] are your covariates. 3.1.2 Multivariate ts object In this example, we have two temperature readings, our responses, and a salinity reading, a covariate. The data are monthly. z &lt;- ts(matrix(rnorm(300), 100, 3), start = c(1961, 1), frequency = 12, names=c(&quot;Temp1&quot;,&quot;Temp2&quot;,&quot;Sal&quot;)) dat &lt;- data.frame(Yr = floor(time(z) + .Machine$double.eps), Month = cycle(z), z) dat &lt;- t(dat) When you call MARSS, dat[c(\"Temp1\",\"Temp2\"),] are the data and dat[c(\"Yr\",\"Month\",\"Sal\"),] are your covariates. See the MARMES chapters that discuss seasonality for examples of how to model season. The brute force method of treating month or quarter as a factor requires estimation of more parameters than is necessary in many cases.

There are text shortcuts for common matrix structures and most of our applications use one of these: \"identity\", \"diagonal and equal\", \"diagonal and unequal\", \"unconstrained\", \"equalvarcov\", \"zero\", \"unequal\", \"equal\" Then there are some special shortcuts for \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}\\).

"],["general-matrix-specification.html", "4.1 General matrix specification", " 4.1 General matrix specification However MARSS() is not limited to the standard forms. MARSS() will fit a general class of constrained MARSS models with linear constraints. The most general way to specify model structure is to use a list matrix. The list matrix allows one to combine fixed and estimated elements in the parameter specification. It allows a one-to-one correspondence between how you write the parameter matrix on paper and how you specify it in R. For example, let’s say \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) have the following forms in your model: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{Q}= \\begin{bmatrix} q&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;q&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\mathbf{u}= \\begin{bmatrix} 0.05\\\\ u_1\\\\ u_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] So \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is a diagonal matrix with the 3rd variance fixed at 1 and the 1st and 2nd estimated and equal. The 1st element of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is fixed, and the 2nd and 3rd are estimated and different. You can specify this using a list matrix: Q &lt;- matrix(list(&quot;q&quot;,0,0,0,&quot;q&quot;,0,0,0,1),3,3) U &lt;- matrix(list(0.05,&quot;u1&quot;,&quot;u2&quot;),3,1) If you print out Q and U, you will see they look exactly like \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) written above. MARSS will keep the fixed values fixed and estimate \\(q\\), \\(u1\\), and \\(u2\\). "],["linear-constraints-1.html", "4.2 Linear constraints", " 4.2 Linear constraints The most general matrix specification is a list matrix with linear constraints. Your model can have simple linear constraints within all the parameters except \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\). For example \\(1+2a-3b\\) is a linear constraint. When entering this value for you matrix, you specify this as \"1+2*a+-3*b\". NOTE: \\(+\\)’s join parts so \\(+-3*b\\) to specify \\(-3b\\). Anything after * is a parameter. So 1*1 has a parameter called \"1\". Example, let’s specify the following matrices: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix}b-0.1&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;b+0.1\\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\mathbf{Q} = \\begin{bmatrix}q_{11}&amp;0\\\\ 1&amp;0\\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\mathbf{Z} = \\begin{bmatrix}z_1-z_2&amp;2*z_1\\\\ 0&amp;z_1\\\\ z_2&amp;0\\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] This would be specified as (notice \"1*z1+-1*z2\" for z1-z2): B1 &lt;- matrix(list(&quot;-0.1+1*b&quot;,0,0,&quot;0.1+1*b&quot;),2,2) Q1 &lt;- matrix(list(&quot;q11&quot;,0,0,1),2,2) Z1 &lt;- matrix(list(&quot;1*z1+-1*z2&quot;,0,&quot;z2&quot;,&quot;2*z1&quot;,&quot;z1&quot;,0),3,2) model.list &lt;- list(B=B1,U=U1,Q=Q1,Z=Z1,A=A1,R=R1,x0=pi1,V0=V1,tinitx=0) "],["time-varying-parameters.html", "4.3 Time-varying parameters", " 4.3 Time-varying parameters All parameters can be time-varying.

The allowable structures are shown using \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) as an example. Note that you should be careful about specifying shared structure in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) because you need to make sure the structure in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) matches. For example, if you require that all the \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) values are shared (equal) then \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) cannot be a diagonal matrix since that would be saying that the \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) values are independent, which they are clearly not if you force them to be equal. U=matrix(list(),m,1): This is the most general form and allows one to specify fixed and estimated elements in \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). Each character string in \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the name of one of the \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) elements to be estimated. For example if U=matrix(list(0.01,\"u\",\"u\"),3,1), then \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) in the model has the following structure: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 0.01 \\\\ u \\\\ u \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] U=matrix(c(),m,1), where the values in c() are all character strings: each character string is the name of an element to be estimated. For example if U=matrix(c(\"u1\",\"u1\",\"u2\"),3,1), then \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) in the model has the following structure: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} u_1 \\\\ u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] with two values being estimated. U=matrix(list(\"u1\",\"u1\",\"u2\"),3,1) has the same effect. U=\"unequal\" or U=\"unconstrained\": Both of these stings indicate that each element of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is estimated. If \\(m=3\\), then \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) would have the form: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} u_1\\\\ u_2\\\\ u_3 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] U=\"equal\": There is only one value in \\(\\mathbf{u}\\): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} u \\\\ u \\\\ u \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] U=matrix(c(),m,1), where the values in c() are all numerical values: \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is fixed and has no estimated values. If U=matrix(c(0.01,1,-0.5),3,1), then \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) in the model is: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 0.01 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -0.5 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] U=matrix(list(0.01,1,-0.5),3,1) would have the same effect. U=\"zero\": \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is all zero: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] The \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) parameter has a special option, \"scaling\", which is the default behavior. In this case, \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is treated like a scaling parameter. If there is only one \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) row associated with an \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) row, then the corresponding \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) element is 0. If there are more than one \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) rows associated with an \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) row, then the first \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) element is set to 0 and the others are estimated. For example, say \\(m=2\\) and \\(n=4\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) looks like the following: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{Z} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Then the 1st-3rd rows of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are associated with the first row of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), and the 4th row of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is associated with the last row of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Then if \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is specified as \"scaling\", \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) has the following structure: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] 4.4.2 \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) The possible \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) model structures are identical, except that \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is \\(n \\times n\\) while \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) are \\(m \\times m\\). All types of structures can be specified using a list matrix, but there are also text shortcuts for specifying common structures. The structures are shown using \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) as the example. Q=matrix(list(),m,m): This is the most general way to specify the parameters and allows there to be fixed and estimated elements. Each character string in the list matrix is the name of one of the \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) elements to be estimated, and each numerical value is a fixed value. For example if Q=matrix(list(&quot;s2a&quot;,0,0,0,&quot;s2a&quot;,0,0,0,&quot;s2b&quot;),3,3) then \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) has the following structure: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\sigma^2_a &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma^2_a &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\sigma^2_b \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Note that diag(c(\"s2a\",\"s2a\",\"s2b\")) will not have the desired effect of producing a matrix with numeric 0s on the off-diagonals. It will have character 0s and MARSS will interpret \"0\" as the name of an element of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) to be estimated. Instead, the following two lines can be used: Q &lt;- matrix(list(0),3,3) diag(Q)=c(&quot;s2a&quot;,&quot;s2a&quot;,&quot;s2b&quot;) Q=\"diagonal and equal\": There is only one process variance value in this case: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\sigma^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma^2 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\sigma^2 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Q=\"diagonal and unequal\": There are \\(m\\) process variance values in this case: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\sigma^2_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma^2_2 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\sigma^2_3 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Q=\"unconstrained\": There are values on the diagonal and the off-diagonals of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and the variances and covariances are all different: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\sigma^2_1 &amp; \\sigma_{1,2} &amp; \\sigma_{1,3}\\\\ \\sigma_{1,2} &amp; \\sigma^2_2 &amp; \\sigma_{2,3} \\\\ \\sigma_{1,3} &amp; \\sigma_{2,3} &amp; \\sigma^2_3 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] There are \\(m\\) process variances and \\((m^2-m)/2\\) covariances in this case, so \\((m^2+m)/2\\) values to be estimated. Note that variance-covariance matrices are never truly unconstrained since the upper and lower triangles of the matrix must be equal. Q=\"equalvarcov\": There is one process variance and one covariance: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\sigma^2 &amp; \\beta &amp; \\beta\\\\ \\beta &amp; \\sigma^2 &amp; \\beta \\\\ \\beta &amp; \\beta &amp; \\sigma^2 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Q=matrix(c(), m, m), where all values in c() are character strings: Each element in \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is estimated and each character string is the name of a value to be estimated. Note if \\(m=1\\), you still need to wrap its value in matrix() so that its class is matrix. You must be careful that your \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) specifies a statistically valid variance-covariance matrix. MARSS() will throw an error/warning telling you if it is not valid. Q=matrix(c(), m, m), where all values in c() are numeric values: Each element in \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is fixed to the values in the matrix. Q=\"identity\": The \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) matrix is the identity matrix: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Q=\"zero\": The \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) matrix is all zeros: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] \\end{itemize} Be careful when setting \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) model structures. Mis-specifying the structure of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) can have catastrophic, but difficult to discern, effects on your estimates. The default behavior for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) is safe. 4.4.3 \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) Like the variance-covariance matrices (\\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\)), \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) can be specified with a list matrix to allow you to have both fixed and shared elements in the \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) matrix. Character matrices and matrices with fixed values operate the same way as for the variance-covariance matrices. In addition, the same text shortcuts are available: \"unconstrained\", \"identity\", \"diagonal and equal\", \"diagonal and unequal\", \"equalvarcov\", and \"zero\". A fixed \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) can be specified with a numeric matrix, but all eigenvalues must fall within the unit circle; meaning ll(abs(eigen(B)\\$values)&lt;=1) must be true. 4.4.4 \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) Like \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and the variance-covariance matrices, \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) can be specified with a list matrix to allow you to have both fixed and estimated elements in \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is a square matrix, many of the same text shortcuts are available: \"diagonal and equal\", \"diagonal and equal\", and \"equalvarcov\". If \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is a design matrix (a matrix with only 0s and 1s and where the row sums are all equal to 1), then a special shortcut is available using factor() which allows you to specify which \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) rows are associated with which \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) rows. Z=factor(c(1,1,1)): All \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) time series are observing the same (and only) hidden state trajectory \\(x\\) (\\(n=3\\) and \\(m=1\\)): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{Z} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Z=factor(c(1,2,3)): Each time series in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) corresponds to a different hidden state trajectory. This is the default \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) model and in this case \\(n=m\\): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{Z} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] Z=factor(c(1,1,2)): The first two time series in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) corresponds to one hidden state trajectory and the third \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) time series corresponds to a different hidden state trajectory. Here \\(n=3\\) and \\(m=2\\): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{Z} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation*}\\] The \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) model can be specified using either numeric or character factor levels. c(1,1,2) is the same as c(\"north\",\"north\",\"south\"). Z=\"identity\": This is the default behavior. This means \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is a \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix and \\(m=n\\). If \\(n=3\\), it is the same as Z=factor(c(1,2,3)). Z=matrix(c(), n, m), where the elements in c() are all character strings: Passing in a \\(n \\times m\\) character matrix, means that each character string is a value to be estimated. Be careful that you are specifying an identifiable model when using this option. Z=matrix(c(), n, m), where the elements in c() are all numeric: Passing in a \\(n \\times m\\) numeric matrix means that \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is fixed to the values in the matrix. The matrix must be numeric but it does not need to be a design matrix. Z=matrix(list(), n, m): Passing in a \\(n \\times m\\) list matrix allows you to combine fixed and estimated values in the \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) matrix.

The default residuals(fit) will return the innovations residuals, which are what are typically used for residuals diagnostics for state-space models. However residuals() and the companion MARSSresiduals() will return all possible residuals for your model. Read about MARSS residuals in ?residuals.marssMLE. To get your parameter estimates, use: coef(fit) $Z [,1] $A [,1] $R [,1] R 0.2023299 $B [,1] $U [,1] U -0.03710875 $Q [,1] Q 0.3520804 $x0 [,1] x0 0.6656819 $V0 [,1] $G [,1] $H [,1] $L [,1] $C [,1] $D [,1] $c [,1] $d [,1] Type ?coef.marssMLE to see the different forms that you can get your estimated parameters in. A common form is as a matrix. To get that use coef(fit, type=\"matrix\").

Numerical errors due to ill-conditioned matrices are not uncommon when fitting MARSS models. The Kalman and EM algorithms need inverses of matrices. If those matrices become ill-conditioned, for example all elements are close to the same value, then the algorithm becomes unstable. Warning messages will be printed if the algorithms are becoming unstable and you can set control$trace=1, to see details of where the algorithm is becoming unstable. Whenever possible, you should avoid using shared \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) values in your model. An example of a \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) with shared values is \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}=\\bigl[\\begin{smallmatrix} a\\\\a\\\\a \\end{smallmatrix} \\bigr]\\). The way the EM algorithm deals with \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) tends to make this case unstable, especially if \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is not diagonal. In general, estimation of a non-diagonal \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is more difficult, more prone to ill-conditioning, and more data-hungry. You may also see non-convergence warnings, especially if your MLE model turns out to be degenerate. This means that one of the elements on the diagonal of your \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) matrix are going to zero (are degenerate). It will take the EM algorithm forever to get to zero. BFGS will have the same problem, although it will often get a bit closer to the degenerate solution. If you are using method=\"kem\", MARSS will warn you if it looks like the solution is degenerate. If you use control=list(allow.degen=TRUE), the EM algorithm will attempt to set the degenerate variances to zero (instead of trying to get to zero using an infinite number of iterations). However, if one of the variances is going to zero, first think about why this is happening. This is typically caused by one of three problems: 1) you made a mistake in inputting your data, e.g. used -99 as the missing value in your data but did not replace these with NAs before passing to MARSS, 2) your data are not sufficient to estimate multiple variances or 3) your data are inconsistent with the model you are trying fit. The algorithms in the MARSS package are designed for cases where the \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) diagonals are all non-minuscule. For example, the EM update equation for \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) will grind to a halt (not update \\(\\mathbf{u}\\)) if \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is tiny (like 1E-7). Conversely, the BFGS equations are likely to miss the maximum-likelihood when \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is tiny because then the likelihood surface becomes hyper-sensitive to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\). The solution is to use the degenerate likelihood function for the likelihood calculation and the EM update equations. MARSS will implement this automatically when \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) diagonal elements are set to zero and will try setting \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) terms to zero automatically if control$allow.degen=TRUE. One odd case can occur when \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) goes to zero (a matrix of zeros), but you are estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\). If model$tinitx=1, then \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}=\\mathbf{x}_1^0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}_1-\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}_1^0\\) can go to 0 as well as \\(\\,\\text{var}(\\mathbf{y}_1-\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}_1^0)\\) by driving \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) to zero. But as this happens, the log-likelihood associated with \\(\\mathbf{y}_1\\) will go (correctly) to infinity and thus the log-likelihood goes to infinity. But if you set \\(\\mathbf{R}=0\\), the log-likelihood will be finite. The reason is that \\(\\mathbf{R} \\approx 0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R}=0\\) specify different likelihoods associated with \\(\\mathbf{y}_1-\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}_1^0\\). With \\(\\mathbf{R}=0\\), \\(\\mathbf{y}_1-\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}_1^0\\) does not have a distribution; it is just a fixed value. So there is no likelihood to go to infinity. If some elements of the diagonal of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) are going to zero, you should be suspect of the parameter estimates. Sometimes the structure of your data, e.g. one data value followed by a long string of missing values, is causing an odd spike in the likelihood at \\(\\mathbf{R} \\approx 0\\). Try manually setting \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) equal to zero to get the correct log-likelihood. The likelihood returned when \\(\\mathbf{R} \\approx 0\\) is not incorrect. It is just not the likelihood that you probably want. You want the likelihood where the \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) term is dropped because it is zero. "],["chap-EM-algorithm.html", "Chapter 12 EM algorithm", " Chapter 12 EM algorithm The MARSS package fits models via maximum likelihood. The MARSS package is unusual among packages for fitting MARSS models in that fitting is performed via a constrained EM algorithm based on a vectorized form of Equation (1.1). Although fitting via the BFGS algorithm is also provided using method=\"BFGS\" and the optim function in R, the examples in this guide use the EM algorithm primarily because it gives robust estimation for datasets replete with missing values and for high-dimensional models with various constraints. However, there are many models/datasets where BFGS is faster and we typically try both for problems. The EM algorithm is also often used to provide initial conditions for the BFGS algorithm (or an MCMC routine) in order to improve the performance of those algorithms. "],["important-notes-about-the-algorithms.html", "12.1 Important notes about the algorithms", " 12.1 Important notes about the algorithms Specification of a properly constrained model with a unique solution is the responsibility of the user because MARSS() has no way to tell if you have specified an insufficiently constrained model—with correspondingly an infinite number of solutions. How do you know if the model is properly constrained? If you are using a MARSS model form that is widely used, then you can probably assume that it is properly constrained. If you go to papers where someone developed the model or method, the issue of constraints necessary to ensure “identifiability” will likely be addressed if it is an issue. Are you fitting novel MARSS models? Then you will need to do some study on identifiability in this class of models using textbooks. Often textbooks do not address identifiability explicitly. Rather it is addressed implicitly by only showing a model constructed in such a way that it is identifiable. In our work, if we suspect identification problems, we will often first do a Bayesian analysis with flat priors and look for oddities in the posteriors, such as ridges, plateaus or bimodality. All the EM code in the MARSS package is currently in native R. Thus the model fitting is slow. The classic Kalman filter/smoother algorithm, as shown in , is based on the original smoother presented in . This Kalman filter is provided in function MARSSkfss(), but the default Kalman filter and smoother used in the MARSS package is based on the algorithm in and papers by Koopman et al. This Kalman filter and smoother is provided in the KFAS package (Helske 2012). Table 2 in indicates that the classic algorithm is 40-100 times slower than the algorithm given in , , and . The MARSS package function MARSSkfas() provides a translator between the model objects in MARSS and those in KFAS so that the KFAS functions can be used. MARSSkfas() also includes a lag-one covariance smoother algorithm as this is not output by the KFAS functions, and it provides proper formulation of the priors so that one can use the KFAS functions when the prior on the states is set at \\(t=0\\) instead of \\(t=1\\). Simply off-setting your data to start at t=2 and sending that value to \\(t_{init}=1\\) in the KFAS Kalman filter would not be mathematically correct! EM algorithms will quickly get in the vicinity of the maximum likelihood, but the final approach to the maximum is generally slow relative to quasi-Newton methods. On the flip side, EM algorithms are quite robust to initial conditions choices and can be extremely fast at getting close to the MLE values for high-dimensional models. The MARSS package also allows one to use the BFGS method to fit MARSS models, thus one can use an EM algorithm to get close and then the BFGS algorithm to polish off the estimate. Restricted maximum-likelihood algorithms are also available for AR(1) state-space models, both univariate and multivariate . REML can give parameter estimates with lower variance than plain maximum-likelihood algorithms. Another maximum-likelihood method is data-cloning which adapts MCMC algorithms used in Bayesian analysis for maximum-likelihood estimation . Missing values are seamlessly accommodated with the MARSS package. Simply specify missing data with NAs. The likelihood computations are exact and will deal appropriately with missing values. However, no innovations, referring to the non-parametric bootstrap developed by Stoffer and Wall (1991), bootstrapping can be done if there are missing values. Instead parametric bootstrapping must be used. You should be aware that maximum-likelihood estimates of variance in MARSS models are fundamentally biased, regardless of the algorithm used. This bias is more severe when one or the other of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is very small, and the bias does not go to zero as sample size goes to infinity. The bias arises because variance is constrained to be positive. Thus if \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is essentially zero, the mean estimate will not be zero and thus the estimate will be biased high while the corresponding bias of the other variance will be biased low. You can generate unbiased variance estimates using a bootstrap estimate of the bias. The function MARSSparamCIs() will do this. However be aware that adding an estimated bias to a parameter estimate will lead to an increase in the variance of your parameter estimate. The amount of variance added will depend on sample size. You should also be aware that mis-specification of the prior on the initial states (\\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\)) can have catastrophic effects on your parameter estimates if your prior conflicts with the distribution of the initial states implied by the MARSS model. These effects can be very difficult to detect because the model will appear to be well-fitted. Unless you have a good idea of what the parameters should be, you might not realize that your prior conflicts. The default behavior for MARSS() is to set \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) to zero and estimate \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\). This does not put any constraints on \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) (there is no \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) to put constraints on) and circumvents this problem. However if you plan to put contraints on \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) or \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\), you should verse yourself in the most common problems. The common problems we have found with priors on \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\) are the following. Problem 1) The correlation structure in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) (whether the prior is diffuse or not) does not match the correlation structure in \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\) implied by your model. For example, you specify a diagonal \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) (independent states), but the implied distribution has correlations. Problem 2) The correlation structure in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) does not match the structure in \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\) implied by constraints you placed on \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\). For example, you specify that all values in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) are shared, yet you specify that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) is diagonal (independent). Unfortunately, using a diffuse prior does not help with these two problems because the diffuse prior still has a correlation structure and can still conflict with the implied correlation in \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\). One way to get around these problems is to set \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}=0\\) (a \\(m \\times m\\) matrix of zeros) and estimate \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\equiv \\mathbf{x}_0\\) only. Now \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) is a fixed but unknown (estimated) parameter, not the mean of a distribution. In this case, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\) does not exist in your model and there is no conflict with the model. This is the default behavior of MARSS(). Unfortunately estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) as a parameter is not always robust. If you specify that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\)=0 and specify that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) corresponds to \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\), but your model explodes when run backwards in time, you cannot estimate \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) because you cannot get a good estimate of \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\). Sometimes this can be avoided by specifying that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\) corresponds to \\(\\mathbf{x}_1\\) so that it can be constrained by the data \\(\\mathbf{y}_1\\). In summary, if the implied correlation structure of your initial states is independent (diagonal variance-covariance matrix), you should generally be ok with a diagonal and high variance prior or with treating the initial states as parameters (with \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}=0\\)). But if your initial states have an implied correlation structure that is not independent, then proceed with caution. With caution means that you should assume you have problems and test how your model fits with simulated data. "],["state-space-form-of-armapq-models.html", "12.2 State-space form of ARMA(p,q) models", " 12.2 State-space form of ARMA(p,q) models There is a large class of models in the statistical finance literature that have the form \\[\\begin{equation*} \\begin{gathered} \\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{x}_t + \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_t\\\\ \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}_t + \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_t\\\\ \\end{gathered} \\end{equation*}\\] For example, ARMA(p,q) models can be written in this form. The MARSS model framework in this package will not allow you to write models in that form. You can put the \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_t\\) into the \\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\) vector and set \\(\\mathbf{R}=0\\) to make models of this form using the MARSS form, but the EM algorithm in the MARSS package won’t let you estimate parameters because the parameters will drop out of the full likelihood being maximized in the algorithm. You can try using BFGS by passing in the method argument to the MARSS() call. "],["chap-other-packages.html", "Chapter 13 Other related packages", " Chapter 13 Other related packages Packages that will do Kalman filtering and smoothing are many, but packages that estimate the parameters in a MARSS model, especially constrained MARSS models, are much less common. The following are those with which we are familiar, however there are certainly more packages for estimating MARSS models in engineering and economics of which we are unfamiliar. The MARSS package is unusual in that it uses an EM algorithm for maximizing the likelihood as opposed to a Newton-esque method (e.g. BFGS). The package is also unusual in that it allows you to specify the initial conditions at \\(t=0\\) or \\(t=1\\), allows degenerate models (with some of the diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) equal to zero). Lastly, model specification in the MARSS package has a one-to-one relationship between the model list in MARSS() and the model as you would write it on paper as a matrix equation. This makes the learning curve a bit less steep. However, the MARSS package has not been optimized for speed and probably will be really slow if you have time-series data with a lot of time points. atsar is an R package we wrote for fitting MARSS models using STAN. It allows fast and flexible fitting of MARSS models in a Bayesian framework. Our book from our time-series class has example applications Applied Time-Series Analysis for Fisheries and Environmental Sciences. The stats package (part of base R) has functions for fitting univariate structural time series models (MARSS models with a univariate \\(y\\)). Read the help file at ?StructTS. The Kalman filter and smoother functions are described here: ?KalmanLike. DLM is an R package for fitting MARSS models. It is mainly Bayesian focused but it does allow MLE estimation via the optim() function. It has a book, Dynamic Linear Models with R by Petris et al., which has many examples of how to write MARSS models for different applications. sspir an R package for fitting ARSS (univariate) models with Gaussian, Poisson and binomial error distributions. dse (Dynamic Systems Estimation) is an R package for multivariate Gaussian state-space models with a focus on ARMA models. SsfPack is a package for Ox/Splus that fits constrained multivariate Gaussian state-space models using mainly (it seems) the BFGS algorithm but the newer versions support other types of maximization. SsfPack is very flexible and written in C to be fast. It has been used extensively on statistical finance problems and is optimized for dealing with large (financial) data sets. It is used and documented in Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods by Durbin and Koopman, An Introduction to State Space Time Series Analysis by Commandeur and Koopman, and Statistical Algorithms for Models in State Space Form: SsfPack 3.0, by Koopman, Shephard, and Doornik. The Brodgar software was developed by Alain Zuur to do (among many other things) dynamic factor analysis, which involves a special type of MARSS model. The methods and many example analyses are given in Analyzing Ecological Data by Zuur, Ieno and Smith. This is the one package that we are aware of that also uses an EM algorithm for parameter estimation. eViews is commercial economics software that will estimate at least some types of MARSS models. KFAS R package provides a fast Kalman filter and smoother. Examples in the package show how to estimate MARSS models using the KFAS functions and R’s optim() function. The MARSS package uses the filter and smoother functions from the KFAS package. S+FinMetrics is a S-plus module for fitting MAR models, which are called vector autoregressive (VAR) models in the economics and finance literature. It has some support for state-space VAR models, though we haven’t used it so are not sure which parameters it allows you to estimate. It was developed by Andrew Bruce, Doug Martin, Jiahui Wang, and Eric Zivot, and it has a book associated with it: Modeling Financial Time Series with S-plus by Eric Zivot and Jiahui Wang. kftrack is an R package provides a suite of functions specialized for fitting MARSS models to animal tracking data. crawl is an R package provides for fitting MARSS models to animal tracking data with covariates.
