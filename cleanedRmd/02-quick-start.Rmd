# How to get started (quickly)

If you already work with models in the form of Equation \ref{eqn:marss}, you can immediately fit your model with the **MARSS** package.  Install the **MARSS** package and then type `library(MARSS)` at the command line to load the package.  Look at the Quick Start Guide and then skim through Chapter \ref{chap:Examples} to, hopefully, find an example similar to your application.  Appendix \ref{chap:modelspec} also has many examples of how to specify different forms for your parameter matrices.
